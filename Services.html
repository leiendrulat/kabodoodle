                <h3>Patent</h3>
                Under United States law, a patent is a right granted to the inventor of a (1) process, machine, article
                of manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) that is new, useful, and non-obvious. A patent is the
                right to exclude others from using a new technology. Specifically, it is the right to exclude others
                from making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, inducing others to infringe, and/or offering
                a product specially adapted for practice of the patent.[1]

                United States patent law is codified in Title 35 of the United States Code, and authorized by the U.S.
                Constitution, in Article One, section 8, clause 8, which states:

                The Congress shall have power ... To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for
                limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;

                Patent law is designed to encourage inventors to disclose their new technology to the world by offering
                the incentive of a limited-time monopoly on the technology. For U.S. utility patents, this limited-time
                term of patent is 20 years from the earliest patent application filing date (but this term can be
                extended via patent term adjustment). After the patent term expires, the new technology enters the
                public domain and is free for anyone to use.

                <h3>Trademarks</h3>
                United States trademark law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. Common law trademark rights are
                acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state
                courts. Marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of
                protection in federal courts than unregistered marksâ€”both registered and unregistered trademarks are
                granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).

                <h3>Copyrights</h3>
                The copyright law of the United States is intended to encourage the creation of art and culture by
                rewarding authors and artists with a set of exclusive rights. Copyright law grants authors and artists
                the exclusive right to make and sell copies of their works, the right to create derivative works, and
                the right to perform or display their works publicly. These exclusive rights are subject to a time
                limit, and generally expire 70 years after the author's death. In the United States, any music composed
                before January 1, 1924, is generally considered public domain.

                United States copyright law was last generally revised by the Copyright Act of 1976, codified in Title
                17 of the United States Code. The United States Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to
                create copyright law under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, known[1] as the Copyright Clause. Under the
                Copyright Clause, Congress has the power, "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by
                securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
                Discoveries."[2]

                The United States Copyright Office handles copyright registration, recording of copyright transfers, and
                other administrative aspects of copyright law.

                <h3>Trade Secrets</h3>
                Trade secrets are a type of intellectual property that comprise formulas, practices, processes, designs,
                instruments, patterns, or compilations of information that have inherent economic value because they are
                not generally known or readily ascertainable by others, and which the owner takes reasonable measures to
                keep secret.[1] In some jurisdictions, such secrets are referred to as confidential information.

                Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not
                generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.[21]

                Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent
                law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court
                issued the landmark decision, Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., which resolved the question in favor of
                allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.
